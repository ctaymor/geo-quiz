Chapter 1
Q1: Why are variable names preceded by "m"?

The Android style convention is to name “member”/instance variables with an m.

Q2: Why is QuizActivity.this used instead of this in Listing 1.13?

You need QuizActivity.this because otherwise, the this would refer to the 
onClickListener, which is the this of that block of code. You need to indicate
that you are calling the method on this instance of QuizActivity not this 
instance of onClickListener.

Q3: You might find this code in Listing 1.13 unclear:
       Toast.makeText(QuizActivity.this,
                      R.string.incorrect_toast,
                      Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
Break it into two separate statements. You will need to define a temporary 
variable. Do you prefer the one- or two-statement version?

Toast mTempToast = Toast.makeText(QuizActivity.this, R.string.incorrect_toast, 
Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);
    mTempToast.show();

I prefer the one-statement version. While it is slightly less clear, it seems
repetitive and unneeded to create a temporary variable just to call show on it.
The two-statement version just seems a little excessive.

Chapter 2
Q4: Right after Listing 2.6, the authors admit that theirs is not the best
option for storing model data.  What isn't so great about it?

Model data should not go in the controller (which is what the QuizActivity
class is). It should go in the model, so it would be better to put the array
 into a class which is in the model somewhere.

Q5: In Listing 2.8, where is the method findViewById(int) defined?  Why don't
you have to specify its class name?.  Why do you have to cast its return value?

It is defined in Activity. You don’t have to specify a class name, because
it is called, be default on this instance of QuizActivity which extends Activity
and thus has its methods. It returns a View, which then must be cast to a Button,
because we want the View to function as a Button. The View has no code which
indicates it should act as a Button, until it is cast as such.

Q6: Why is updateQuestion() (in Listing 2.9) an instance method (as opposed
to a static method)?

updateQuestion is an instance method because it will be called on the instanc
 of QuizActivity (implicitly, by an invisible this.)

Q7: In Listing 10, there is a 5-line if-else statement (counting braces). 
Rewrite it into a single statement, as simple as possible.  Do you prefer
the longer or shorter version?

messageResId = R.string.incorrect_toast;
if (userPressedTrue == answerIsTrue){messageResId = R.string.correct_toast};

I prefer the longer version, it is more straightforward. Also, it makes me
nervous to have assigned the default value to the incorrect string. It seems
like it might not make errors here obvious.
