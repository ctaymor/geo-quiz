Lab 3 Questions
Q1: Can period notation be used in the definition of QuizActivity in the
manifest (Listing 5.4)?  If so, change it.  If not, why not?

Yes, it is possible, and I have changed it.

Q2: Why is android:layout_gravity specified in Figure 5.6
(layout-land/activity_quiz.xml) but not Listing 5.5 (layout/activity_quiz.xml)?

I wasn't clear on this at first, so I tried removing the layout_gravity in 
layout-land/activity_quiz.xml. Cheat button popped up to the top left corner.
I think it has to do with how FrameLayout (used in the landscape layout)
functions differently than LinearLayout.
I did a little more research on this (see references below), and it seems like the
reason gravity is not needed for LinearLayout is that it automatically lines things up
either horizontally or vertically. Since we set the android:orientation to vertical and
gravity of the layout to center, it lines everything up in a column in the center. However
with frame layout, it doesn't line up everything in any nice way. Instead, we specify
where we want each element with gravity.

Q3: Which activity is shown on the recents screen?  Does it depend on which
activity you were most recently in?
